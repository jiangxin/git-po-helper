Review and improve the translation quality in `{source}` according to `po/README.md`.

You need to review all translation entries in the file, identify issues, and directly modify the PO file to fix them. After reviewing, output a JSON summary of the issues found.

## Review Process

1. Read the PO file `{source}` carefully
2. Review each translation entry for:
   - Terminology accuracy
   - Consistency with other translations
   - Style and readability
   - Correctness of meaning
3. **Directly modify the PO file** to fix issues you find:
   - Update msgstr values for better translations
   - Fix terminology errors
   - Improve consistency
   - Refine style
4. After modifying the file, output a JSON summary of all issues you found and fixed

## Output Format

After modifying the PO file, output a JSON object with the following structure:
- "total_entries": Total number of translation entries reviewed
- "issues": Array of review issues, each containing:
  - "msgid": Original message ID
  - "msgstr": Translated message string (original, before your fix)
  - "score": Issue score (0 = critical/must fix, 1 = major/shoud fix, 2 = minor/needs adjustment, 3 = perfect)
  - "description": Description of the issue
  - "suggestion": Suggested improvement (or the fixed translation)

## Scoring Guidelines

### Score 0 - Critical (Must Fix Immediately)
**Broken translations that cause serious problems, and must fix before any release:**
- Incorrect meaning or contradicts the original
- Missing translations or unresolved fuzzy markers
- Completely unrelated content

### Score 1 - Major (Should Fix)
**Significant issues affecting usability, and should fix before release:**
- **Placeholders:** Variables (`%s`, `{name}`, `$1`) not preserved
- **Technical content:** Code, paths, commands, or brand names incorrectly translated
- **Terminology:** Wrong technical or domain-specific terms
- **Clarity:** Vague or confusing translations

### Score 2 - Minor (Recommended to Improve)
**Quality issues that don't break functionality, and can be improved in future updates:**
- **Consistency:** Inconsistent terminology or phrasing
- **Style:** Awkward or non-idiomatic expressions
- **Grammar:** Minor grammatical or fluency issues
- **Localization:** Plural forms, gender, or cultural adaptations

### Score 3 - Perfect (No Action Needed)
**High-quality translation with no issues, and ready for production:**
- Accurate and faithful to the original
- Natural and idiomatic
- Technically correct
- Consistent and well-formatted

## Example Output

{
  "total_entries": 2592,
  "issues": [
    {
      "msgid": "commit",
      "msgstr": "承诺",
      "score": 0,
      "description": "严重错误：偏离业务背景",
      "suggestion": "提交"
    },
    {
      "msgid": "repository",
      "msgstr": "版本库",
      "score": 2,
      "description": "一致性问题：其他地方使用'仓库'",
      "suggestion": "仓库"
    },
    {
      "msgid": "The file has been modified",
      "msgstr": "文件已被修改了",
      "score": 2,
      "description": "风格问题：表达冗余",
      "suggestion": "文件已修改"
    }
  ]
}

## Instructions

1. **First, read and modify the PO file {source} directly** - fix all issues you find
2. **Then, output only the JSON object** - no additional text before or after
3. Include all entries reviewed in total_entries count
4. Only include entries with issues in the issues array (perfect entries with score 3 should not be included)
5. The "suggestion" field should contain the improved translation (which you've already applied to the file)

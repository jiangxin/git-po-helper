Fix the PO file "{{.source}}" so that it passes `msgfmt --check`.

The file currently fails validation with the following error:

```
{{.error}}
```

Read the PO file, identify and fix the syntax errors reported by msgfmt. Common issues include:
- Invalid escape sequences in msgid/msgstr (e.g. unescaped `\`, `"`, newlines)
- Mismatched plural forms (msgstr_plural count vs Plural-Forms)
- Malformed multi-line entries (msgid "" / msgstr "" with continuation lines)
- Invalid format directives (e.g. %s, %d in c-format)

Modify the file "{{.source}}" directly in place. Preserve the content and meaning of translations; only fix syntax. After fixing, the file must pass `msgfmt --check -o /dev/null {{.source}}`.

Review the translation changes in file "{source}" since commit "{commit}" according to @po/README.md.

You need to review all modified translation entries and output the review results in JSON format.

## Output Format

Output a JSON object with the following structure:
- "total_entries": Total number of translation entries reviewed
- "issues": Array of review issues, each containing:
  - "msgid": Original message ID
  - "msgstr": Translated message string
  - "score": Issue score (0 = critical/must fix, 1 = major/shoud fix, 2 = minor/needs adjustment, 3 = perfect)
  - "description": Description of the issue
  - "suggestion": Suggested improvement

## Scoring Guidelines

### Score 0 - Critical (Must Fix Immediately)
**Broken translations that cause serious problems, and must fix before any release:**
- Incorrect meaning or contradicts the original
- Missing translations or unresolved fuzzy markers
- Completely unrelated content

### Score 1 - Major (Should Fix)
**Significant issues affecting usability, and should fix before release:**
- **Placeholders:** Variables (`%s`, `{name}`, `$1`) not preserved
- **Technical content:** Code, paths, commands, or brand names incorrectly translated
- **Terminology:** Wrong technical or domain-specific terms
- **Clarity:** Vague or confusing translations

### Score 2 - Minor (Recommended to Improve)
**Quality issues that don't break functionality, and can be improved in future updates:**
- **Consistency:** Inconsistent terminology or phrasing
- **Style:** Awkward or non-idiomatic expressions
- **Grammar:** Minor grammatical or fluency issues
- **Localization:** Plural forms, gender, or cultural adaptations

### Score 3 - Perfect (No Action Needed)
**High-quality translation with no issues, and ready for production:**
- Accurate and faithful to the original
- Natural and idiomatic
- Technically correct
- Consistent and well-formatted
